            <h1>Carousel</h1>
            <p> A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text—like a carousel.
                The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a
                bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support
                for previous/next controls and indicators.

                In browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the webpage
                is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is minimized,
                etc.).

                Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are generally not compliant with
                accessibility standards.

                Lastly, if you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js.

                    (86.9 m) steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron District
                    neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan, New York City. Designed by Daniel Burnham and Frederick
                    Dinkelberg, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city upon its 1902 completion, at 20 floors
                    high,[6] and one of only two "skyscrapers" north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan
                    Life
                    Insurance Company Tower, one block east. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth
                    Avenue,
                    Broadway, and East 22nd Street – where the building's 87-foot (27 m) back end is located – with East
                    23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped
                    buildings, the name "Flatiron" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.</p>

                    original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century,
                    working
                    class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the

                    There is an urgent need to preserve existing greenery as well as grow new plants for the existence
                    of
                    human
                    beings on this planet.</p>

                <h4>Bridge</h4>
                <p>A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, such as a body of water, valley, or road,
                    without
                    closing the way underneath. It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the
                    obstacle,
                    usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. There are many different
                    designs
                    that
                    each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending
                    on
                    the
                    function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the
                    material
                    used to make it and the funds available to build it.
